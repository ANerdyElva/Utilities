Tool to create an image for bitmasked terrain as shown in "http://www.angryfishstudios.com/2011/04/adventures-in-bitmasking/".

Currently everything is hardcoded, the mask is (0,0,0) for the first image and (255,255,255) for the second, everything else is copied as is.
It uses the files 'water.png', 'desert.png' and 'Layout.png' in the current directory (not included).
